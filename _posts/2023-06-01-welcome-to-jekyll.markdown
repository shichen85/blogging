You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

```ts
import ps from 'child_process';
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs-extra';
import core from '@actions/core';

const outPath = process.env.OUT_PATH as string;
const baseName = process.env.baseName as string;
let executableName = process.env.executableName as string;
if (executableName == '${project_name}') {
  executableName = baseName;
}
const exeDir = path.join(outPath, `${executableName}.exe`);
if (!fs.existsSync(exeDir)) {
  throw new Error(`${exeDir} does not exist`);
}
```

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```


```bash
#!/bin/bash

###### CONFIG
ACCEPTED_HOSTS="/root/.hag_accepted.conf"
BE_VERBOSE=false

if [ "$UID" -ne 0 ]
then
 echo "Superuser rights required"
 exit 2
fi

genApacheConf(){
 echo -e "# Host ${HOME_DIR}$1/$2 :"
}

echo '"quoted"' | tr -d \" > text.txt
```
